    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>A recipe I created as a broke college student that has since become a signature dish for myself in a way. Cheap,
        easy to make, and easy to clean up, these cajun porkchops epitomize the college eating mentality. With a little
        refinement over the years, the flavors have become more robust without sacrificing the original principles of
        the dish.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 - 6 bone-in porkchops</li>
        <li>1 medium sweet onion, halved and sliced</li>
        <li>4 - 5 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Cajun Seasoning</li>
        <li>1 lemon, sliced</li>
        <li>1 bottle BBQ sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F.</li>
        <li>Heat a pan over medium heat and add the olive oil and garlic. After the garlic becomes fragrant and slightly
            toasted, add the onion, salt and pepper. Stir until slightly translucent.</li>
        <li>Remove the garlic and onion from the pan. Sear each side of the porkchops while seasoning each side
            generously.</li>
        <li>Layer the onion and garlic mixture on the bottom of a baking dish (at least 1 inch deep).</li>
        <li>Place the porkchops on top of this mixture, adding lemon slices to the tops of each porkchop.</li>
        <li>Cover the porkchops with the BBQ sauce, and then lightly cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Cook the porkchops for 25 - 35 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 145F. Serve with your
            choice of sides.</li>
    </ol>

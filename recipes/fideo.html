    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>A traditional Mexican comfort food. Fideo can be made in many different ways, making it perfect for anyone who is
        on a vegan or vegetarian diet. This super quick dish is a go-to when time is tight and you want a spicy and
        savory meal.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>1 pound beefsteak tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red-pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup neutral cooking oil, such as grapeseed</li>
        <li>8 ounces 1-inch fideo (3 cups)</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, whole</li>
        <li>1 carrot, whole</li>
        <li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the garlic, tomatoes, red-pepper flakes, cumin and salt to a blender, and blend until smooth. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a medium pot over medium, then add the oil. Add the fideo to the hot oil and cook until toasted and
            aromatic, about 5 minutes. Be sure to constantly mix the fideo so it toasts evenly.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, then add the blended tomato mixture.</li>
        <li>Add 5 cups of water to the pot, along with the celery, carrot and bay leaf. Mix and taste for salt,
            adjusting if necessary.</li>
        <li>Increase to medium heat until simmering, then reduce to medium-low. Cook for 25 minutes, stirring
            occasionally, until the fideo is cooked through, the soup has melded together and the liquid has thickened.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the celery, carrot and bay leaf, and discard. Serve soup in bowls and top with any of your favorite
            sopa de fideo toppings.</li>
    </ol>

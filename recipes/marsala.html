    <h1>Chicken Marsala</h1>

    <img src="../img/marsala.jpeg" alt="A plate of chicken marsala over pasta">

    <p>A classic Italian dish that is a staple in restaurants the world over. While the common preparation is usually a cream-based
        sauce, I am opting for a more traditional approach. Laid over a bed of buccatini and paired with a crusty slice
        of bread, this rustic dish will be sure to please.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>3 small shallots, chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup chestnut mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 tbsp flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup marsala wine</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>flat leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover the chicken breasts with a cling wrap and pound them with a meat mallet until they are no thicker than Â½ inch. Sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides and dredge in flour.</li>
            <li>Fry in olive oil until golden over medium-high heat for approximately 5 minutes. Do not over cook as the chicken breasts will be quite thin and will cook fast.</li>
            <li>Remove to a separate plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>To the same pan add chopped shallots and cook over low heat for 2-3 minutes, then add the sliced mushrooms, salt and pepper and saute for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp of flour, stir and cook for a minute longer, then add marsala wine and turn the heat up to medium.</li>
            <li>Add chicken stock and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a gentle simmer and return the chicken to the pan.</li>
            <li>Let it heat through in the sauce, simmer for a few minutes to allow the sauce to thicken to a desired consistency.</li>
            <li>Serve sprinkled with chopped parsley and a side dish of your choice.</li>
        </ol>
